## Abstract
We plan to build a wallet aggregator library for vue.js which will help UI developers building on algorand to make wallet integration to applications much more easier.

## Team
AP - CEO. I have 7 years of experience in sales and marketing for multiple MNCs in India. I have been an active member in the Algorand community since August 2021 and is involved with Notiboy project.

Deepak -CTO. Deepak has a Masters in computer science and has worked in product design & development for leading payment companies in the world. He is well versed in the Algorand smart contracts and SDKs and has been leading the design and development of Notiboy project.

## Present Proposal
Vue.Js is the second most popular framework after React.JS for startups. As algorand expands to Asia (where the framework is most popular) more developers 
with proficiency in Vue.js will start building on Algorand. Use-Wallet library by TXN Labs have made it easier for React.JS developers
to integrate wallets to dApps. We would like to provide same experience for Vue.JS developers.

## Future Blueprint
Build the library and publish an NPM package.

## Benefits for the community
Developers using Vue.js framework will find it easier to build faster UI for algorand. More UI developers attracted to the ecosystem.
